		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Genomics and bioinformatics data often are generated at many hierarchical levels.  
		For example, an <a href="http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/">RPD</a> 11classification of a 16S rRNA experiment yields 
		calls to phylum, class, order, family and then genus with each level nested within the one above it.  
		So a phylum can have many classes, which in turn can have many orders and so forth.  
		For an rna-seq experiment on abacteria, reads can be mapped to genes, which in turn can be grouped into 
		operons, with one to many genes per operon.  In performing inference, it is not trivial to interpret these 
		multiple levels.  Typically, levels are chosen ahead of time and infernence is constrained to that level.  
		For example, it is common to perform RDP analyses at the genus or phyla level.  
		But such a-priori filtering of the data may miss important patterns; for example, for some taxa 
		a difference at the genus level might be important, while for other taxa in the same experiment, a 
		meaningful signal wonâ€™t be observed unless a less derived phylogenetic level is considered.  

		<p>In order to visualize such cases, this web page contains a demonstration project for visualization of 
		phylogenetic trees.  In this <a href=ForceTree.html?FileToOpen=ismeJRDP_CaseControl.json> example</a> 
		we consider RDP classifications of a <a href=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v6/n10/full/ismej201243a.html>
		previously published experiment</a>.  
		This was a 454-based 16S rRNA experiment in which punch biopsies were collected from <a href=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v6/n10/fig_tab/ismej201243t1.html#figure-title>33 subjects with 
		adenomas and 38 (control) subjects without adenomas.</a>.  In the analysis presented on this web page,
		578,096 sequences were run through the stand-alone version of the RDP classifier (version 2.6).
		Classifications to each phylogenetic level (phylum, class, order, family, genus) were taken if
		the bootstrap value was >= 50. For each taxa at each level in the tree, a t-test was performed
		testing the null hypothesis that the log-normalized distribution of that taxa was the same in 
		case vs. control.
		
		The visualization <a href=ForceTree.html?FileToOpen=ismeJRDP_CaseControl.json>shown here</a> (for Chrome 
		browsers only) shows the phylogenetic tree that results from this analysis.  By default, the size of
		each circle is the number of sequences assigned to each node:

		 height=400 width=400 align=middle src="treeShowingPhylogeneticLevels.jpg"></img></center>
		
		<p>If in the <a href=ForceTree.html?FileToOpen=ismeJRDP_CaseControl.json>demonstration</a> we hover the mouse over each of 
		the large dots at the phylum level, we see that the three mostabundant taxa in our samples were Phylum Firmicutes (with 
		340,933 sequences), Phylum Bacteroidetes (with 142,231 sequences)and Phylum Proteobacteria (with 67,926 sequences) as
		we might expect from a human gut micro-environment.
		
		<p>One of the nice things about the demonstration is that we can switch between a traditional circular 
		phylogenetic tree (as in the Figure above) and a Force Tree view.  We can do this by clicking on
		the "reanimate" button in the left hand control panel.   When we do this, the view switches to a view in
		which opposing forces position each node.  These forces include "gravity" which tends to pull each node
		to the center of the screen, a repulsive focce between each node and an elastic spring-like force that 
		in this case reflects the phyologentic distance between different taxonomic levels (so for example the
		distance between genus and family will be shorter than the distance between genus and order):
